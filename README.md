My implementation of the solution to Project Euler Problem 34: Digit Factorials

The solution uses a simple brute force strategy.

What is the sum of all numbers who, when you sum up the factorials of their individual digits equals the original number.

Example: 1! + 4! + 5! = 145

Surprisingly there are only two such numbers.
